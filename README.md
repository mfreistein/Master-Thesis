Evaluating 3D Image Classification Using Single RGB-D Images

This paper aims to improve conventional RGB image classification systems through the simple addition of depth information derived from the RGB images themselves. As a proof of concept, it uses the SynthNet RGB image classification pipeline, which achieved state-of-the-art results on the VisDA dataset, as a baseline and integrates monocular estimated depth channels. Specifically, it attempts to improve Acc@1 on the Topex dataset, a complex machine parts dataset defined by a significant synthetic to real domain gap. Utilizing the latest in transfer learning strategies, vision transformers and monocular depth estimation models, the study devises strategies for data augmentation, model adaptation, and the application of freezing schedules. It also conducts a thorough comparison of depth data integration techniques, compares the performance of monocular estimated versus CAD rendered depth data and provides a detailed error analysis of the best performing models. The findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in classification accuracy, culminating in a model that achieves an Acc@1 of 69.70\%. The applied methods offer practical solutions to industrial challenges and blueprints for integrating depth data into cutting edge classification models.
